# Basic Model Building



## Linear Regression
  - This procedure fits a straight line to the data. The idea is that the independent variable x is something the experimenter controls and the dependent variable y is something that the experimenter measures. The line is used to predict the value of y for a known value of x. The variable x is the predictor variable and y the response variable.
  - First proposed many years ago. But still very useful ...

  - The equation takes the form $\hat{y}=b_0+b_1 * x$
  - The method used to choose the values $b_0$ and $b_1$ is to minimize the sum of the squares of the residual errors.

## Galton Data


```{r}
library(UsingR); data(galton)
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
hist(galton$child,col="blue",breaks=100)
hist(galton$parent,col="blue",breaks=100)
plot(galton$parent,galton$child,pch=1,col="blue", cex=0.4)
lm1 <- lm(galton$child ~ galton$parent)
lines(galton$parent,lm1$fitted,col="red",lwd=3)
plot(galton$parent,lm1$residuals,col="blue",pch=1, cex=0.4)
abline(c(0,0),col="red",lwd=3)
qqnorm(galton$child)
```

  
## Linear Regression Diagnostics
  - Several plots help to evaluate the suitability of the linear regression 
    + *Residuals vs fitted*: The residuals should be randomly distributed around the horizontal line representing a residual error of zero; that is, there should not be a distinct trend in the distribution of points. 
    + *Standard Q-Q plot*: residual errors are normally distributed
    + *Square root of the standardized residuals vs the fitted value*s: there should be no obvious trend.
    + *Leverage*: measures the importance of each point in determining the regression result. Smaller values means that removing the observation has little effect on the regression result. 



## China dataset. Linear regression. Fitting a linear model to log-log
  - the predictive power equation is $y= e^{b_0 + b_1 log(x)}$, ignoring the bias corrections
  - First, we are fitting the model to the whole dataset. But it is not the right way to do it, because of overfitting.
  
#```{r}
#linmodel_logchina <- lm(logchina_effort ~ logchina_size)
#par(mfrow=c(1,1))
#plot(logchina_size, logchina_effort)
#abline(linmodel_logchina, lwd=3, col=3)
#par(mfrow=c(1,2))
#plot(linmodel_logchina, ask = FALSE)
#linmodel_logchina
