# Data Analysis in Software Engineering (DASE)

Javier Dolado and Daniel Rodriguez

(DRAFT `r Sys.Date()`)


This course covers sereral aspects of data analysis in Software Engieering (SE) and is been created by [Javier Dolado](www.sc.ehu.eus/jiwdocoj/) at the [University of the Basque Country](www.ehu.eus) and [Daniel Rodriguez](http://www.cc.uah.es/drg) at the [University of Alcala](http://www.uah.es/).

It is mainly based on [R](http://cran.r-project.org) and [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/) but we will also show some examples in [Weka](http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/) and other packages. [RMarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) can be compiled to html (and other formats) with RStudio's Knit.

It is structured as follows:
