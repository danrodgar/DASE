  Abstract                 = {Mining software repositories (MSRs) such as source control repositories, bug repositories, deployment logs, and code repositories provide useful patterns for practitioners. Instead of using these repositories as record-keeping ones, we need to transform them into active repositories that can guide the decision processes inside the company. By MSRs with several data mining algorithms, effective software fault prediction models can be built and error-prone modules can be detected prior to the testing phase. We discuss numerous real-world challenges in building accurate fault prediction models and present some solutions to these challenges. ऊ 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

  Abstract                 = {Background: The accurate prediction of where faults are likely tooccur in code can help direct test effort, reduce costs and improve the quality of software. Objective: We investigate how the context of models, the independent variables used and the modelling techniques applied, influence the performance of fault prediction models.Method:We used a systematic literature review to identify 208 fault prediction studies published from January 2000 to December 2010. We synthesise the quantitative and qualitative results of 36 studies which report sufficient contextual and methodological information according to the criteria we develop and apply. Results: The models that perform well tend to be based on simple modelling techniques such as Na\F6\80\81\8Eve Bayes or Logistic Regression. Combinations of independent variables have been used by models thatperform well. Feature selection has been applied to these combinations when models are performing particularly well. Conclusion: The methodology used to build models seems to be influential to predictive performance. Although there are a set of fault prediction studies in which confidence is possible, more studies are needed that use a reliable methodology and which report theircontext, methodology and performance comprehensively.}

  Abstract                 = {With the continuous expansion of data availability in many large-scale, complex, and networked systems, such as surveillance, security, Internet, and finance, it becomes critical to advance the fundamental understanding of knowledge discovery and analysis from raw data to support decision-making processes. Although existing knowledge discovery and data engineering techniques have shown great success in many real-world applications, the problem of learning from imbalanced data (the imbalanced learning problem) is a relatively new challenge that has attracted growing attention from both academia and industry. The imbalanced learning problem is concerned with the performance of learning algorithms in the presence of underrepresented data and severe class distribution skews. Due to the inherent complex characteristics of imbalanced data sets, learning from such data requires new understandings, principles, algorithms, and tools to transform vast amounts of raw data efficiently into information and knowledge representation. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of the development of research in learning from imbalanced data. Our focus is to provide a critical review of the nature of the problem, the state-of-the-art technologies, and the current assessment metrics used to evaluate learning performance under the imbalanced learning scenario. Furthermore, in order to stimulate future research in this field, we also highlight the major opportunities and challenges, as well as potential important research directions for learning from imbalanced data.},

  Abstract                 = { This paper presents a subgroup discovery algorithm APRIORI-SD, developed by adapting association rule learning to subgroup discovery. The paper contributes to subgroup discovery, to a better understanding of the weighted covering algorithm, and the properties of the weighted relative accuracy heuristic by analyzing their performance in the ROC space. An experimental comparison with rule learners CN2, RIPPER, and APRIORI-C on UCI data sets demonstrates that APRIORI-SD produces substantially smaller rulesets, where individual rules have higher coverage and significance. APRIORI-SD is also compared to subgroup discovery algorithms CN2-SD and SubgroupMiner. The comparisons performed on U.K. traffic accident data show that APRIORI-SD is a competitive subgroup discovery algorithm. },

  Abstract                 = {The quality of data is an important issue in any domain-specific data mining and knowledge discovery initiative. The validity of solutions produced by data-driven algorithms can be diminished if the data being analyzed are of low quality. The quality of data is often realized in terms of data noise present in the given dataset and can include noisy attributes or labeling errors. Hence, tools for improving the quality of data are important to the data mining analyst. We present a comprehensive empirical investigation of our new and innovative technique for ranking attributes in a given dataset from most to least noisy. Upon identifying the noisy attributes, specific treatments can be applied depending on how the data are to be used. In a classification setting, for example, if the class label is determined to contain the most noise, processes to cleanse this important attribute may be undertaken. Independent variables or predictors that have a low correlation to the class attribute and appear noisy may be eliminated from the analysis. Several case studies using both real-world and synthetic datasets are presented in this study. The noise detection performance is evaluated by injecting noise into multiple attributes at different noise levels. The empirical results demonstrate conclusively that our technique provides a very accurate and useful ranking of noisy attributes in a given dataset.},
