  Abstract                 = {A wide variety of software metrics have been proposed and a broad range of tools is available to measure them. However, the effective use of software metrics is hindered by the lack of meaningful thresholds. Thresholds have been proposed for a few metrics only, mostly based on expert opinion and a small number of observations. Previously proposed methodologies for systematically deriving metric thresholds have made unjustified assumptions about the statistical properties of source code metrics. As a result, the general applicability of the derived thresholds is jeopardized. We designed a method that determines metric thresholds empirically from measurement data. The measurement data for different software systems are pooled and aggregated after which thresholds are selected that (i) bring out the metric's variability between systems and (ii) help focus on a reasonable percentage of the source code volume. Our method respects the distributions and scales of source code metrics, and it is resilient against outliers in metric values or system size. We applied our method to a benchmark of 100 object-oriented software systems, both proprietary and open-source, to derive thresholds for metrics included in the SIG maintainability model.},

  Abstract                 = {A practical application of object oriented measures is to predict which classes are likely to contain a fault. This is contended to be meaningful because object oriented measures are believed to be indicators of psychological complexity, and classes that are more complex are likely to be faulty. Recently, a cognitive theory was proposed suggesting that there are threshold effects for many object oriented measures. This means that object oriented classes are easy to understand as long as their complexity is below a threshold. Above that threshold their understandability decreases rapidly, leading to an increased probability of a fault. This occurs, according to the theory, due to an overflow of short-term human memory. If this theory is confirmed, then it would provide a mechanism that would explain the introduction of faults into object oriented systems, and would also provide some practical guidance on how to design object oriented programs. The authors empirically test this theory on two C++ telecommunications systems. They test for threshold effects in a subset of the Chidamber and Kemerer (CK) suite of measures (S. Chidamber and C. Kemerer, 1994). The dependent variable was the incidence of faults that lead to field failures. The results indicate that there are no threshold effects for any of the measures studied. This means that there is no value for the studied CK measures where the fault-proneness changes from being steady to rapidly increasing. The results are consistent across the two systems. Therefore, we can provide no support to the posited cognitive theory},

  Abstract                 = {Cross-project defect prediction is very appealing because (i) it allows predicting defects in projects for which the availability of data is limited, and (ii) it allows producing generalizable prediction models. However, existing research suggests that cross-project prediction is particularly challenging and, due to heterogeneity of projects, prediction accuracy is not always very good. This paper proposes a novel, multi-objective approach for cross-project defect prediction, based on a multi-objective logistic regression model built using a genetic algorithm. Instead of providing the software engineer with a single predictive model, the multi-objective approach allows software engineers to choose predictors achieving a compromise between number of likely defect-prone artifacts (effectiveness) and LOC to be analyzed/tested (which can be considered as a proxy of the cost of code inspection). Results of an empirical evaluation on 10 datasets from the Promise repository indicate the superiority and the usefulness of the multi-objective approach with respect to single-objective predictors. Also, the proposed approach outperforms an alternative approach for cross-project prediction, based on local prediction upon clusters of similar classes.},

In addition, method-level metrics are still the most dominant metrics in fault prediction research area and machine learning algorithms are still the most popular methods for fault prediction. Researchers working on software fault prediction area should continue to use public datasets and machine learning algorithms to build better fault predictors. The usage percentage of class-level is beyond acceptable levels and they should be used much more than they are now in order to predict the faults earlier in design phase of software life cycle.},

  Abstract                 = {This article proposes a new measure to compare soft computing methods for software estimation. This new measure is based on the concepts of Equivalence Hypothesis Testing (EHT). Using the ideas of EHT, a dimensionless measure is defined using the Minimum Interval of Equivalence and a random estimation. The dimensionless nature of the metric allows us to compare methods independently of the data samples used. The motivation of the current proposal comes from the biases that other criteria show when applied to the comparison of software estimation methods. In this work, the level of error for comparing the equivalence of methods is set using EHT. Several soft computing methods are compared, including genetic programming, neural networks, regression and model trees, linear regression (ordinary and least mean squares) and instance-based methods. The experimental work has been performed on several publicly available datasets. Given a dataset and an estimation method we compute the upper point of Minimum Interval of Equivalence, MIEu, on the confidence intervals of the errors. Afterwards, the new measure, MIEratio, is calculated as the relative distance of the MIEu to the random estimation. Finally, the data distributions of the MIEratios are analysed by means of probability intervals, showing the viability of this approach. In this experimental work, it can be observed that there is an advantage for the genetic programming and linear regression methods by comparing the values of the intervals.},

Conclusions: One: Researchers need to analyse the data that forms the basis of their findings in the context of how it will be used.

This is mainly due to repeated data points potentially causing substantial amounts of training and testing data to be identical.},

We synthesize the quantitative and qualitative results of 36 studies which report sufficient contextual and methodological information according to the criteria we develop and apply. Results: The models that perform well tend to be based on simple modeling techniques such as Naive Bayes or Logistic Regression. Combinations of independent variables have been used by models that perform well. Feature selection has been applied to these combinations when models are performing particularly well. Conclusion: The methodology used to build models seems to be influential to predictive performance. Although there are a set of fault prediction studies in which confidence is possible, more studies are needed that use a reliable methodology and which report their context, methodology, and performance comprehensively.},

Conducting ODC classification on existing organizational defect reports is human intensive and requires experts' knowledge of both ODC and system domains. This paper presents AutoODC, an approach and tool for automating ODC classification by casting it as a supervised text classification problem. Rather than merely apply the standard machine learning framework to this task, we seek to acquire a better ODC classification system by integrating experts' ODC experience and domain knowledge into the learning process via proposing a novel Relevance Annotation Framework. We evaluated AutoODC on an industrial defect report from the social network domain. AutoODC is a promising approach: not only does it leverage minimal human effort beyond the human annotations typically required by standard machine learning approaches, but it achieves an overall accuracy of 80.2\% when using manual classifications as a basis of comparison.},

This paper presents an iterative feature selection method to deal with these two problems. The proposed method consists of an iterative process of data sampling followed by feature ranking and finally aggregating the results generated during the iterative process. In this study, we investigate a number of feature ranking techniques and a data sampling method with two different post-sampling proportions between the two classes. We compare the iterative feature selection technique to the one where a data sampling and a feature ranking technique are used together but only once (without iteration). The empirical study is carried out on two groups of highly imbalanced data sets from a real-world software system. The results demonstrate that our proposed iterative feature selection technique performs on average better than the method without iteration.},

  Abstract                 = {Software defect prediction strives to improve software quality and testing efficiency by constructing predictive classification models from code attributes to enable a timely identification of fault-prone modules. Several classification models have been evaluated for this task. However, due to inconsistent findings regarding the superiority of one classifier over another and the usefulness of metric-based classification in general, more research is needed to improve convergence across studies and further advance confidence in experimental results. We consider three potential sources for bias: comparing classifiers over one or a small number of proprietary data sets, relying on accuracy indicators that are conceptually inappropriate for software defect prediction and cross-study comparisons, and, finally, limited use of statistical testing procedures to secure empirical findings. To remedy these problems, a framework for comparative software defect prediction experiments is proposed and applied in a large-scale empirical comparison of 22 classifiers over 10 public domain data sets from the NASA Metrics Data repository. Overall, an appealing degree of predictive accuracy is observed, which supports the view that metric-based classification is useful. However, our results indicate that the importance of the particular classification algorithm may be less than previously assumed since no significant performance differences could be detected among the top 17 classifiers.},

Current defect prediction techniques are mainly based on a sufficient amount of historical project data. However, historical data is often not available for new projects and for many organizations. In this case, effective defect prediction is difficult to achieve. To address this problem, we propose sample-based methods for software defect prediction. For a large software system, we can select and test a small percentage of modules, and then build a defect prediction model to predict defect-proneness of the rest of the modules. In this paper, we describe three methods for selecting a sample: random sampling with conventional machine learners, random sampling with a semi-supervised learner and active sampling with active semi-supervised learner. To facilitate the active sampling, we propose a novel active semi-supervised learning method ACoForest which is able to sample the modules that are most helpful for learning a good prediction model. Our experiments on PROMISE datasets show that the proposed methods are effective and have potential to be applied to industrial practice.},

  Abstract                 = {Accurate detection of fault prone modules offers the path to high quality software products while minimizing non essential assurance expenditures. This type of quality modeling requires the availability of software modules with known fault content developed in similar environment. Establishing whether a module contains a fault or not can be expensive. The basic idea behind semi-supervised learning is to learn from a small number of software modules with known fault content and supplement model training with modules for which the fault information is not available. In this study, we investigate the performance of semi-supervised learning for software fault prediction. A preprocessing strategy, multidimensional scaling, is embedded in the approach to reduce the dimensional complexity of software metrics. Our results show that the semi-supervised learning algorithm with dimension-reduction preforms significantly better than one of the best performing supervised learning algorithms, random forest, in situations when few modules with known fault content are available for training.},

  Abstract                 = {The knowledge about the software metrics which serve as defect indicators is vital for the efficient allocation of resources for quality assurance. It is the process metrics, although sometimes difficult to collect, which have recently become popular with regard to defect prediction. However, in order to identify rightly the process metrics which are actually worth collecting, we need the evidence validating their ability to improve the product metric-based defect prediction models. This paper presents an empirical evaluation in which several process metrics were investigated in order to identify the ones which significantly improve the defect prediction models based on product metrics. Data from a wide range of software projects (both, industrial and open source) were collected. The predictions of the models that use only product metrics (simple models) were compared with the predictions of the models which used product metrics, as well as one of the process metrics under scrutiny (advanced models). To decide whether the improvements were significant or not, statistical tests were performed and effect sizes were calculated. The advanced defect prediction models trained on a data set containing product metrics and additionally Number of Distinct Committers (NDC) were significantly better than the simple models without NDC, while the effect size was medium and the probability of superiority (PS) of the advanced models over simple ones was high p=.016, which is a substantial finding useful in defect prediction. A similar result with slightly smaller PS was achieved by the advanced models trained on a data set containing product metrics and additionally all of the investigated process metrics p=.038. The advanced models trained on a data set containing product metrics and additionally Number of Modified Lines (NML) were significantly better than the simple models without NML, but the effect size was small p=.038. Hence, it is reasonable to recommend the NDC process metric in building the defect prediction models.},

In this paper we present an empirical study aiming at statistically analyzing the equivalence of different defect predictors. We also propose a combined approach, coined as CODEP (COmbined DEfect Predictor), that employs the classification provided by different machine learning techniques to improve the detection of defect-prone entities. The study was conducted on 10 open source software systems and in the context of cross-project defect prediction, that represents one of the main challenges in the defect prediction field. The statistical analysis of the results indicates that the investigated classifiers are not equivalent and they can complement each other. This is also confirmed by the superior prediction accuracy achieved by CODEP when compared to stand-alone defect predictors.},

  Abstract                 = {Data mining methods in software engineering are becoming increasingly important as they can support several aspects of the software development life-cycle such as quality. In this work, we present a data mining approach to induce rules extracted from static software metrics characterising fault-prone modules. Due to the special characteristics of the defect prediction data (imbalanced, inconsistency, redundancy) not all classification algorithms are capable of dealing with this task conveniently. To deal with these problems, Subgroup Discovery (SD) algorithms can be used to find groups of statistically different data given a property of interest. We propose EDER-SD (Evolutionary Decision Rules for Subgroup Discovery), a SD algorithm based on evolutionary computation that induces rules describing only fault-prone modules. The rules are a well-known model representation that can be easily understood and applied by project managers and quality engineers. Thus, rules can help them to develop software systems that can be justifiably trusted. Contrary to other approaches in SD, our algorithm has the advantage of working with continuous variables as the conditions of the rules are defined using intervals. We describe the rules obtained by applying our algorithm to seven publicly available datasets from the PROMISE repository showing that they are capable of characterising subgroups of fault-prone modules. We also compare our results with three other well known SD algorithms and the EDER-SD algorithm performs well in most cases.},

  Abstract                 = {Empirical validation of software metrics used to predict software quality attributes is important to ensure their practical relevance in software organizations. The aim of this work is to find the relation of object-oriented (OO) metrics with fault proneness at different severity levels of faults. For this purpose, different prediction models have been developed using regression and machine learning methods. We evaluate and compare the performance of these methods to find which method performs better at different severity levels of faults and empirically validate OO metrics given by Chidamber and Kemerer. The results of the empirical study are based on public domain NASA data set. The performance of the predicted models was evaluated using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis. The results show that the area under the curve (measured from the ROC analysis) of models predicted using high severity faults is low as compared with the area under the curve of the model predicted with respect to medium and low severity faults. However, the number of faults in the classes correctly classified by predicted models with respect to high severity faults is not low. This study also shows that the performance of machine learning methods is better than logistic regression method with respect to all the severities of faults. Based on the results, it is reasonable to claim that models targeted at different severity levels of faults could help for planning and executing testing by focusing resources on fault-prone parts of the design and code that are likely to cause serious failures.},

This paper deals with the role that the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)-based classification technique AntMiner+ can play as a comprehensible data mining technique to predict erroneous software modules. In an empirical comparison on three real-world public datasets, the rule-based models produced by AntMiner+ are shown to achieve a predictive accuracy that is competitive to that of the models induced by several other included classification techniques, such as C4.5, logistic regression and support vector machines. In addition, we will argue that the intuitiveness and comprehensibility of the AntMiner+ models can be considered superior to the latter models.},

We confirm the ranking ability of LOC discovered by Fenton and Ohlsson. Furthermore, we find that the ranking ability of LOC can be formally described using Weibull functions. We can use defect density values calculated from a small percentage of largest modules to predict the number of total defects accurately. We also find that, given LOC we can predict the number of defective components reasonably well using typical classification techniques. We perform an extensive experiment using the public Eclipse dataset, and replicate the study using the NASA dataset. Our results confirm that simple static code attributes such as LOC can be useful predictors of software quality.},

We additionally annotated the data with common complexity metrics. All data is publicly available and can serve as a benchmark for defect prediction models.},
